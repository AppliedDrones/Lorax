# Lorax
I am the Lorax. I speak for the trees. I speak for the trees for the trees have no tongues.

## Problem Statement
Deforestation is a major driver of climate change and biodiversity loss, with millions of trees lost each year. Traditional reforestation efforts struggle to keep pace due to high costs, labor shortages, and difficult terrain. A scalable, autonomous solution is needed to restore forests efficiently.

## Solution
An autonomous quadcopter system designed for large-scale reforestation. Using advanced navigation, seed deployment, and environmental monitoring, we can plant trees in remote or degraded areas with precision using cost-effective drone swarms. The goal: plant 1,000,000 trees to help combat deforestation and restore ecosystems.

## Technologies Used
Hardware – Retrofitting an existing agricultural drone with Nvidia computing units for onboard autonomy.
Software – ROS2, Nvidia Isaac ROS Suite, C++.
